Novagon is a VR polygonal 3d modelling program I made for fun for Oculus/Vive and Quest. 

For the mesh structure, I used a version of Probuilder which I had to modify a bit to do the real-time operations I needed and I implemented a UI for changing tool modes and performing operations. After a number of iterations I found that using pie menus work really well for this as opposed to a standard point and click menu. 

Selecting mesh elements in VR was a challenge. I had to implement a number of algorithms to find the intersection between triangles and edges in order to determine which mesh elements should be selected. I also had to keep track of which elements were selected in order to perform mesh operations like extrude, bridge, and edge loops. 

The most difficult tool to implement was the knife tool, but I really like how it turned out. 

I also implemented in a undo / redo system which kept track of incremental changes, this was incredibly tricky to make work correctly, and one mistake could end up completely mangling the mesh. 

I would love to further develop this project into a complete VR software package!
